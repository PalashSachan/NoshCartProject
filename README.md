learning ASP.NET for me as a student is very fun for me..It's a demo shopping website for learning educational purpose only


This NoshCart(FoodCart) Project in INCOMPLETE and is Under Development.
So, There are many bugs(especially in UI when opened in small screen or mobile web browsers and don't have much known bugs in code).

(this website in hosted on the free server(https://www.myasp.net/) so its temporary available only till Dec 5, 2017)

GitHub Repository:-

https://github.com/PalashSachan/NoshCartProject

Tip:
Due to some reasons this zip file does not contain the database file
So, Before Running the application you have to do the following things:-

1.Execute or Run the database script file "ShoppingDB_SQL_Script.sql" present in the "App_Data" Folder.
2.Modify the "Connection String" in "Web.Config" File.

If, everything went fine then the project will run perfectly.
