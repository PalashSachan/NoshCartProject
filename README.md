# NoshCartProject


Learning ASP.NET for me as a student is very fun..It's a demo shopping website for learning educational purpose only

A website in ASP.NET of Indian restaurant which provide verity of
food as well as contain information about food (from where it belongs), it provides various
information regarding the places and provides multiple options to contact and review places.

It also has many features like Sign-in, Sign-up, cart items updating, sending order
confirmation email and message in customer mobile number, order details and many more.


This NoshCart(FoodCart) Project in INCOMPLETE and is Under Development.

So, There are many bugs(especially in UI when opened in small screen or mobile web browsers and don't have much known bugs in code).

(this website in hosted on the free server(https://www.myasp.net/) so its temporary available only till Dec 5, 2017)

GitHub Repository:-

https://github.com/PalashSachan/NoshCartProject

Note:-

Due to some reasons this zip file does not contain the database file

So, Before Running the application you have to do the following things:-

1.Execute or Run the database script file "ShoppingDB_SQL_Script.sql" present in the "App_Data" Folder.

2.Modify the "Connection String" in "Web.Config" File.

If, everything went fine then the project will run perfectly.
